# DNF (Drug Network Fusion) or CGNF (Chemogenomics Network Fusion), previously named drugSNF
Decoding compound mechanism of action using integrative pharmacogenomics

This project assess the utility of data integration from multiple drug information layers.

Hypothesis: Better characterization of compound mechanism of action (MoA) from integrative pharmacogenomics.

Impact: Identifying mechanism for compounds with unknown MoA in early stages of drug development without the need 
of sophisticated info (side effects or pharmacological indications...)
